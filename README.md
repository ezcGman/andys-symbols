# Andy's Symbols
While designing some PCBs, I ended up creating a few footprints myself, which sometimes also needed complete new symbols. So here they are!

## E-Byte-E32-xxxM20S
Symbol for the E-Byte E32-400M20S & E32-900M20S LoRa (SPI) module: https://www.ebyte.com/en/product-view-news.html?id=1613

## E-Byte-E220-xxxT22S
Symbol for the E-Byte E220-400T22S & E220-900T22S LoRa module: https://www.ebyte.com/en/product-view-news.html?id=1211. Pretty sure it will also fit a lot of other E220 modules, as they share the same pinout

## ESP-12E-IO-9-10
A modified version of the ESP-12F symbol to only have IO 9 & 10 from the bottom pins to match my ESP-12F socket footprint that supports IO 9&10: https://github.com/ezcGman/andys-footprints/blob/master/Andys-Footprints.pretty/ESP-12-Socket-IO9-10.kicad_mod

## RotaryEncoder_Switch_LED
This is the custom rotary encoder symbol for thr CN Futai RGB rotary encoders and the footprint I made for them: https://github.com/ezcGman/andys-footprints/blob/master/Andys-Footprints.pretty/LED_RotaryEncoder_CN_Futai_EC12-Switch_Vertical_H20mm.kicad_mod
